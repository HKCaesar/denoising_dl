# denoising_dl
image or video denoising based on deep learning and other machine learning method
The program will explore many neural network to denoise still image and will extend to video denoising in the future.
Currently, the MLP/CNN/CNN with batch normalization is implemented. 
The compared golden program is BM3D, the python version comes from : https://github.com/liuhuang31/BM3D-Denoise
The original BM3D is matlab version here : http://www.cs.tut.fi/~foi/GCF-BM3D/
